# pirate's creek
Essentially a search engine for r/piratedgames's megathread (only DDLs though)

## Installation
clone the repo
also install python 3.6 or above (if you haven't already done so)
install requests_html, requests and flask:
 - ```pip install flask```
 - ```pip install requests```
 - ```pip install requests-html```

## Running

 - Ignore everything else, just run ```flask_App.py``` (it is inside /src)
 - It should automatically pull up a new tab and go to a specific local url with a randomised port number
 - If your country blocks any of the sites, you might get an ```internal server error``` with code 500, in this case, just VPN to any other country (I've personally found that South Korea/Taiwan/Japan never block anything)
 - Enter the game that you wanna find and then just press 'return / enter', it may look like its stuck, BUT DON'T PANIC - it's just very slow (go get a glass of water - it usually takes around 45 seconds to do a full search) 
 
## Contributing

IDK who's gonna contribute but whatever:
 - we have notes in ```/other random stuff``` - try to go through those milestones first
 - Yes, some sites are borked (we know) - just set up a Github issue and we'll (@mystery-z or @iCraft85) try to respond to it.
